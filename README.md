I’m currently working on Māori data sets of Iwi, hapū and marae names that will allow for varioius Māori Data Soverignty data sets of collected data in government and various other databases. 

The intention is that these data sets can be included into an new or existing database that allows the individual to choose thier Iwi, hapū and or marae.

🤔 I’m looking for collaboration to review this living data 👯 

Also to hear from people using the data set. 📫 http://www.taiuru.maori.nz
